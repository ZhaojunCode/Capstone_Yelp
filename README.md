Contact @samomullane for active keys, unable to publicly declare these on github

## Updated initial EDA databricks notebook:

## Uploaded a quick set for IL
/processed_data/numeric_ID_set_IL
In this set, user_id and business_id are turned into numeric id's. This is mainly for social graph generation and simple searching. The python notebook will be uploaded, yet this kind of operation is MUCH faster using spark and databricks. The python notebook routine should be viewed as a backup approach.
